# Contributing to APEX

This guide explains how the repository is organized, where new content should go, and the process for submitting contributions.

---

## Repository Architecture

APEX organizes content into four directories, each serving a distinct purpose in the agentic workflow. Understanding the distinction is critical — putting content in the wrong place degrades the agent's performance.

```

## `skills/` — Domain Knowledge

**Purpose:** Self-contained packages of specialized knowledge that the AI agent loads on demand. Skills follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io/).

**Think of skills as:** An expert's brain — the accumulated knowledge, decision frameworks, and best practices that a senior SA carries. The agent consults this knowledge regardless of what task it's performing.

### Characteristics

- **Reusable across workflows** — the same `eks-best-practices` skill is used whether the agent is designing a new cluster, reviewing an existing architecture, planning an upgrade, or troubleshooting an issue
- **Stateless** — no conversation flow, no "ask the user this, then do that." Pure knowledge.
- **Triggered by description match** — the agent reads the `description` field in SKILL.md frontmatter and decides whether to activate the skill based on the user's request
- **Progressive disclosure** — SKILL.md contains the essentials (~500 lines max), `references/` contains deep-dive material loaded only when needed

### Structure

```
skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter (name, description) + body
├── references/           # Optional: detailed reference docs (loaded on demand)
│   ├── topic-a.md
│   └── topic-b.md
├── scripts/              # Optional: executable code for deterministic tasks
└── assets/               # Optional: files used in output (templates, etc.)
```

> **Naming:** Prefix skill names with the target service (`eks-`, `ecs-`) for auto-grouping in docs and README. Non-service skills use a descriptive name without prefix.

> **DevOps Agent ports:** DevOps Agent ports retain the same skill name and live under `devops-agent/` (not `skills/`). Constraints: no scripts, no Bash — markdown only.


### What Belongs in Skills

| ✅ Belongs | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Decision frameworks | Compute selection matrix (Karpenter vs MNG vs Auto Mode vs Fargate) |
| Best practices | Security essentials (IAM, Pod Identity, PSA, network policies) |
| Reference tables | Upgrade sequence rules (control plane → add-ons → data plane) |
| Code patterns | Terraform module patterns and naming conventions |
| Quick wins | Cost optimization table (Graviton, Spot, consolidation) |

### What Does NOT Belong in Skills

| ❌ Does not belong | Why | Where it goes |
|-------------------|-----|---------------|
| "Ask the user these 8 phases of questions" | That's a conversation flow | `steering/workflows/` |
| A Terraform module that deploys a cluster | That's runnable infrastructure | `examples/` |
| A deploy.sh script that sets up a demo | That's a hands-on exercise | `examples/` |
| Checkpoint templates with STOP gates | That's agent behavior control | `steering/workflows/` |

### Current Skills

See the auto-generated [Skills Reference](README.md#skills-reference) in `README.md` — regenerated from each `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` frontmatter by `misc/update-skills-references.sh` (and enforced by CI via `misc/update-all-references.sh`), so it can't fall out of sync with the repo.

---

## `steering/` — Conversation Orchestration

**Purpose:** Files that control how the agent interacts with the user — routing intent, sequencing steps, gathering requirements, enforcing checkpoints, and validating output.

**Think of steering as:** A senior SA's playbook — not what they know (that's skills), but how they run an engagement. The structured questionnaire they follow, the checkpoints they enforce, the quality gates they apply before delivering recommendations.

### Characteristics

- **Defines interaction patterns** — questionnaires, step-by-step procedures, STOP gates, checkpoint templates
- **Routes user intent** — "if the user says 'upgrade my cluster', activate the upgrade workflow"
- **References skills for knowledge** — steering files say "use the `eks-best-practices` skill's decision frameworks" but don't duplicate the knowledge
- **Workflow-specific** — each workflow file handles one lifecycle phase (design, upgrade, troubleshoot)
- **Has a hub** — `eks.md` is the central router that detects intent and dispatches to the right workflow

### Structure

```
steering/
├── eks.md                    # Service hub: EKS intent detection + routing
├── apex.md                   # Meta hub: repo-wide contributor actions (new-skill, …)

│       └── new-skill.md      # /apex:new-skill → steering/workflows/new-skill.md
└── workflows/
    ├── design.md             # Day 0: Architecture questionnaire + quality check
    ├── eks-build.md          # Day 1: Cluster build and provisioning
    ├── eks-operation-review.md  # Day 2: Operational health review
    ├── eks-platform-engineering.md  # Day 2: Platform engineering assessment
    ├── eks-upgrade-check.md  # Day 2: Pre-flight → plan → execute → validate
    └── new-skill.md          # Meta: onboard a new skill end-to-end
```

### Why Hub + Workflows (Not Monolithic)

1. **Context efficiency** — the agent loads only the relevant workflow, not all of them
2. **Independent iteration** — improve the upgrade workflow without touching design
3. **Clear ownership** — different SAs can own different workflows
4. **Shared context** — the hub carries context between workflows (design decisions inform upgrade planning)

### What Belongs in Steering

| ✅ Belongs | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Questionnaires | The 8-phase design questionnaire (Phase 1: Project Context → Phase 8: Confirm & Generate) |
| Pre-flight checklists | Upgrade pre-flight with STOP gates ("STOP if blocking PDBs found") |
| Quality gates | Scoring rubric (80% threshold across Well-Architected pillars) |
| Intent routing | "User says 'upgrade my cluster' → activate upgrade workflow" |
| Checkpoint templates | "✅ Step N complete. Validation: ... Ready for Step N+1?" |
| Mandatory warnings | "Once the control plane is upgraded, you CANNOT roll it back" |
| Conditional branches | "Terraform detected? → Terraform path. CLI-managed? → CLI path." |
| Slash command wrappers | Command files that map `/apex:eks-design` to the design workflow |

### What Does NOT Belong in Steering

| ❌ Does not belong | Why | Where it goes |
|-------------------|-----|---------------|
| EKS best practices content | That's domain knowledge | `skills/` |
| Terraform code patterns | That's domain knowledge | `skills/` |
| A deployable Terraform module | That's runnable infrastructure | `examples/` |

### The Key Test

If you removed all steering files, would the agent still *know* the right answers? **Yes** — skills provide the knowledge. But the agent wouldn't know *how to run the engagement* — it wouldn't follow the questionnaire, enforce checkpoints, or validate output quality.

---

## `examples/` — Hands-On Exercises

**Purpose:** Deployable, runnable scenarios that demonstrate APEX workflows in practice. They include infrastructure code, planted issues, test scripts, and documented test results.

**Think of examples as:** A workshop lab — the actual environment where someone can deploy infrastructure, run APEX against it, and see the agent in action. Examples are how we validate that steering + skills actually work, and how we deliver workshops to customers.

### Characteristics

- **Runnable** — `deploy.sh` creates infrastructure, `destroy.sh` tears it down
- **Self-contained** — each example includes everything needed to run the exercise
- **Demonstrates a workflow** — each example maps to a steering workflow (e.g., an example demonstrating `steering/workflows/design.md`)
- **Contains planted issues** — realistic problems for the agent to discover and fix
- **Documents test results** — conversation logs showing how the agent performed, with issue tables and fix tracking
- **Used for iteration** — test results drive improvements to steering files (test-01 → fix steering → test-02)

### Structure

```
examples/{scenario}/{variant}/
├── README.md              # Required: frontmatter (name, description, workflow) + exercise guide
├── manifests/             # Kubernetes manifests (planted issues, test resources)
├── scripts/
│   ├── deploy.sh          # Deploy the exercise environment
│   └── destroy.sh         # Clean up everything
├── static/                # Screenshots, diagrams
└── tests/
    ├── test-01.md         # Full conversation log from test run 1
    └── test-02.md         # Full conversation log from test run 2
```

Each example's `README.md` must include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: EKS Upgrade Readiness
description: Assess cluster upgrade readiness across 8 dimensions with a scored report.
workflow: steering/workflows/eks-upgrade-check.md
---
```

- `name` — short label (required)
- `description` — one-line summary (required)
- `workflow` — which steering workflow this example demonstrates (optional)

### What Belongs in Examples

| ✅ Belongs | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Deployable infrastructure | Terraform that creates an EKS 1.30 cluster |
| Planted issues | Kubernetes manifests with deprecated APIs, blocking PDBs, stale RBAC |
| Deploy/destroy scripts | `deploy.sh` that sets up the exercise environment |
| Test conversation logs | Issue tables (what went well, what failed, fixes made) |
| Screenshots | Agent behavior during test runs |

### What Does NOT Belong in Examples

| ❌ Does not belong | Why | Where it goes |
|-------------------|-----|---------------|
| Best practices documentation | That's domain knowledge | `skills/` |
| Conversation flow definitions | That's agent orchestration | `steering/` |
| Generic reference material | That's skill reference content | `skills/{name}/references/` |

## Creating a New Skill

The happy path is the `/apex:new-skill` workflow — it onboards a skill end-to-end, including the obligations to the rest of the repo (catalogues, sibling disambiguation, triggering prompts) that are easy to skip when hand-authoring. Running it produces exactly the artefacts the [Pre-PR checklist](#pre-pr-checklist-for-new-skills) below enumerates, so you do not need to cross-check two lists at review time.

```
/apex:new-skill
```

The workflow is bimodal:

- **Greenfield** — `skills/<name>/` does not exist. Phase 2 invokes the [`skill-creator`](skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md) skill to draft `SKILL.md` + references.
- **Retrofit** — `skills/<name>/` already exists (the skill was authored outside the workflow). Phase 2 is skipped; the workflow still walks sibling survey, fan-out, eval scaffold, and baseline so the skill catches up on its repo obligations.

Both modes converge on Phase 3 (sibling survey) → Phase 4 (repo fan-out) → Phase 5 (triggering prompts) → Phase 6 (PR prep). Full spec at [`steering/workflows/new-skill.md`](steering/workflows/new-skill.md).

### Manual path

If you prefer to drive the steps yourself without the workflow:

1. Understand the skill with concrete examples.
2. Plan reusable contents (scripts, references, assets).
3. Hand-author `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and any `references/` / `agents/` / `scripts/` / `assets/` subdirectories (no scaffolding script exists — see [`skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md`](skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md)).
4. Author `misc/evals/<name>/triggering.json` (≥16 prompts: ≥8 positives, ≥8 near-miss negatives).
5. Update every neighbour's sibling map and triggering.json using `python misc/evals/scripts/update_sibling_map.py` — one call per neighbour.
6. Fan out across the repo: update `skills/README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the relevant service hub (`steering/<service>.md`) if service-scoped, and any other catalogue that lists skills.
7. Package: `python skills/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py skills/<name>`.

Both paths land the same artefacts; the workflow just orchestrates and surfaces a fan-out diff you can review as a single unit.

### Pre-PR checklist for new skills

Each item is something `/apex:new-skill` will have produced by the end of Phase 6. If you took the manual path, verify each one before opening the PR.

- [ ] `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` present with valid frontmatter
- [ ] `misc/evals/<name>/triggering.json` has ≥16 prompts (≥8 positives, ≥8 negatives)
- [ ] Every neighbour's `SIBLING_MAP` block in `misc/evals/<neighbour>/README.md` lists this new skill, and the corresponding negatives are in `misc/evals/<neighbour>/triggering.json`
- [ ] Catalogue entries landed: `skills/README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and (if service-scoped) the relevant service hub

### Keeping skill docs in sync after changes

Adding, renaming, or removing a skill — or editing a SKILL.md frontmatter description — should be followed by running the `update-docs` skill so wrappers, marker blocks, and prose references stay in sync. The skill walks both script-managed surfaces (`update-all-references.sh`, `update-pages.sh`) and hand-written prose, proposing diffs for anything stale.

## Creating a New Steering Workflow

1. Create `steering/workflows/<name>.md`
2. Add a header linking back to the hub: `> **Part of:** [APEX EKS Hub](../eks.md)`
3. Add an intent routing table at the top
4. Structure as phases with numbered checklists and STOP gates
5. Add the workflow to the hub's routing table in `steering/eks.md`
6. Create a corresponding command file in `steering/commands/apex/eks-<name>.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and an `@steering/workflows/<name>.md` execution context reference
7. Run `misc/update-steering-references.sh` to update the README
8. Test with a real scenario and document results in `examples/`

## Keeping docs in sync (auto-generated catalogues)

Three catalogues in the repo are **auto-generated** from each entry's frontmatter and must not be edited by hand:

| Block | Rendered in | Source of truth | Regenerator |
|---|---|---|---|
| Skills Reference | `README.md`, `skills/README.md` | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` frontmatter | `misc/update-skills-references.sh` |
| Steering Reference | `README.md` | `steering/**/*.md` frontmatter | `misc/update-steering-references.sh` |
| Examples Reference | `README.md` | `examples/**/README.md` frontmatter | `misc/update-examples-references.sh` |

Each block is delimited by HTML markers like `<!-- SKILLS_REFERENCE_START -->` / `<!-- SKILLS_REFERENCE_END -->`. The regenerator owns everything between the markers; anything outside them is free.

**One-shot refresh** (run this whenever you add a skill, workflow, or example, or change a frontmatter field):

```bash
./misc/update-all-references.sh
```

**CI enforcement.** The `docs-sync` job in `.github/workflows/docs-sync.yml` runs `./misc/update-all-references.sh --check` and `./misc/update-pages.sh --check` on every PR. If the rendered blocks or Docusaurus wrappers diverge from frontmatter, the job fails and prints the exact diff. The fix is always the same: run both commands locally, commit the result.

## Creating a New Example

1. Create `examples/<scenario>/<variant>/`
2. Add `README.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `workflow`) and exercise guide (overview, prerequisites, setup, expected outcome)
3. Add `scripts/deploy.sh` and `scripts/destroy.sh`
4. Add planted issues in `manifests/` or infrastructure code
5. Run the exercise with APEX and document results in `tests/`
6. Use test results to iterate on the corresponding steering workflow
7. Run `misc/update-examples-references.sh` to update the README

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and

## Releasing to npm

1. Run `./misc/bump-version.sh <version>` (e.g. `./misc/bump-version.sh 1.2.0`)
2. Commit the version bump
3. Push to main
4. Create a GitHub Release tagged `v<version>` targeting main
5. The `release-npm.yml` workflow auto-publishes to npm via OIDC trusted publisher
6. Verify: `npm view apex-skills` shows the new version

**Pre-releases:** Tags containing `-` (e.g. `1.2.0-rc.1`) publish to the `next` dist-tag.

**Rollback:** `npm deprecate apex-skills@<version> "reason"` + publish a patch.


## Finding Contributions to Work On

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.

## Licensing

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for our project's licensing. We will ask you to confirm the licensing of your contribution.

### Per-skill `license:` frontmatter

Most skills in this repo are authored in-house under Amazon copyright and are governed by the repo's root [LICENSE](LICENSE) file (MIT-0). These skills MUST NOT declare a `license:` field in their `SKILL.md` frontmatter — the repo LICENSE governs.

Only skills synced from an upstream project carry their own `license:` field and a sibling `LICENSE` file in the skill directory, and MUST be accompanied by an entry in [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). See `skills/terraform-skill/` (Apache-2.0, synced from `antonbabenko/terraform-skill`) and `skills/skill-creator/` (Apache-2.0, synced from `anthropics/skills`) for examples. Do not edit these skills directly — changes belong upstream, and the local copy is overwritten on the next sync (see `misc/sync-*.sh`).
