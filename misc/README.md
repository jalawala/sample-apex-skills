# Miscellaneous Scripts  


This folder contains miscellaneous scripts to help maintain this repo.  

## Evaluate Skills

Per-skill evaluation inputs (triggering tests and task prompts) live under [`evals/`](./evals/). These feed the tooling in [`skills/skill-creator/`](../skills/skill-creator/).

**Check that every skill has an eval entry** (coverage — no live model needed):

```bash
cd evals
make check-evals-coverage
```

Fails with a list of missing skills and a hint to run `make init-evals SKILL=<name>`. Exits 0 when every `skills/<name>/` (minus upstream-synced `skill-creator` and `terraform-skill`) has a matching `evals/<name>/`.

**Evaluate all skills**:

```bash
cd evals
make validate-all      # frontmatter + 64/1024-char limits (deterministic, no live model)
make triggering-all    # triggering accuracy (requires live `claude -p` session)
```

`validate-all` is safe to run anywhere. `triggering-all` fans out across all 10 maintained skills and takes minutes per skill. The eval framework uses a 5-layer architecture (triggering → process → artifact → knowledge → quality) with composite scoring and letter grades — see [`evals/README.md`](./evals/README.md) for the full capability catalogue (A–K) and the onboarding path for adding a new skill.

## Update README - Skills and Steering  

Various READMEs references Skills and Steering files. We do not want to have to manually edit everytime some change is made to either folder. Thus, created scripts to read the frontmatter of both and update the READMEs accordingly:  

**For Skills**  

```bash
chmod +x update-skills-references.sh  
./update-skills-references.sh
```  

**For Steering**  

```bash
chmod +x update-steering-references.sh  
./update-steering-references.sh
```

**For Examples**  

```bash
chmod +x update-examples-references.sh  
./update-examples-references.sh
```

## Sync External Skills  

Some skills are sourced from external upstream repos and treated as the source of truth. These sync scripts clone the upstream repo into a temp directory, wipe the local copy, and replace it entirely with the upstream version. They are idempotent — run them anytime to pull the latest.  

> **Important:** We only sync — we do not modify third-party content. See [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for license details and downstream redistribution obligations.

### skill-creator  

Syncs from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) — Anthropic's official skill-creator.  

```bash
chmod +x sync-skill-creator.sh  
./sync-skill-creator.sh
```  

After syncing, run `./update-skills-references.sh` to regenerate the skills README.

### terraform-skill  

Syncs from [antonbabenko/terraform-skill](https://github.com/antonbabenko/terraform-skill) — Comprehensive Terraform and OpenTofu best practices skill by Anton Babenko. Licensed under Apache 2.0.  

```bash
chmod +x sync-terraform-skill.sh  
./sync-terraform-skill.sh
```  

After syncing, run `./update-skills-references.sh` to regenerate the skills README.

**What gets synced:** Core skill components only — `SKILL.md`, `LICENSE`, `references/*.md`  
**What gets excluded:** Everything else (README, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, tests/, `.github/`, `.claude-plugin/`)
