<objective>
Route the user's EKS request to the appropriate workflow using the APEX EKS steering hub.

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/apex-steering/eks.md
</execution_context>

<process>
Read the steering hub and follow its routing logic. Detect the user's intent from their message and route to the appropriate workflow (design or upgrade). If the request doesn't match a workflow, use the eks-best-practices skill directly.
