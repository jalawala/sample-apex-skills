# Report Generation

> **Part of:** [eks-cost-intelligence](../)
> **Purpose:** Deterministic scoring algorithm, dimension weights, classification bands, SKIPPED dimension handling, and the complete markdown report template

## Scoring Algorithm

The Cost Score starts at 100 and applies severity-weighted deductions per dimension. The algorithm is deterministic: the same set of findings always produces the same score.

### Dimension Weights (Max Deductions)

| Dimension | Weight (Max Deduction) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Compute Efficiency | 25 |
| Spot/Graviton Adoption | 20 |
| Networking Costs | 15 |
| Storage Costs | 15 |
| Observability Costs | 10 |
| Idle Resources | 15 |
| **Total** | **100** |

### Severity-Weighted Deduction Formulas

Each finding contributes a deduction based on its severity and the dimension's max deduction:

| Severity | Deduction per Finding | Formula |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| CRITICAL | 60% of max_deduction | `dimension.max_deduction × 0.6` |
| HIGH | 30% of max_deduction | `dimension.max_deduction × 0.3` |
| MEDIUM | 15% of max_deduction | `dimension.max_deduction × 0.15` |
| LOW | 5% of max_deduction | `dimension.max_deduction × 0.05` |

**Concrete examples by dimension:**

| Dimension | Max | CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW |
|-----------|-----|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Compute Efficiency | 25 | 15.0 | 7.5 | 3.75 | 1.25 |
| Spot/Graviton Adoption | 20 | 12.0 | 6.0 | 3.0 | 1.0 |
| Networking Costs | 15 | 9.0 | 4.5 | 2.25 | 0.75 |
| Storage Costs | 15 | 9.0 | 4.5 | 2.25 | 0.75 |
| Observability Costs | 10 | 6.0 | 3.0 | 1.5 | 0.5 |
| Idle Resources | 15 | 9.0 | 4.5 | 2.25 | 0.75 |

### Deduction Cap Rule

Each dimension's actual deduction is **capped** at its max_deduction. Multiple findings within a dimension accumulate but cannot exceed the cap:

```
actual_deduction = min(sum_of_finding_deductions, dimension.max_deduction)
```

### SKIPPED Dimension Handling

When a dimension cannot be assessed (missing data source, insufficient permissions):

- The dimension's status is set to `SKIPPED`
- The dimension contributes **zero deduction** to the total score
- The dimension is **excluded from scoring** entirely (not penalized)
- The report notes the exclusion with the reason and remediation steps

### Complete Pseudocode

```
score = 100

for each dimension in [compute, spot_graviton, networking, storage, observability, idle]:
    if dimension.status == SKIPPED:
        dimension.actual_deduction = 0
        continue
    
    deduction = 0
    for each finding in dimension.findings:
        if finding.severity == CRITICAL: deduction += dimension.max_deduction * 0.6
        if finding.severity == HIGH:     deduction += dimension.max_deduction * 0.3
        if finding.severity == MEDIUM:   deduction += dimension.max_deduction * 0.15
        if finding.severity == LOW:      deduction += dimension.max_deduction * 0.05
    
    dimension.actual_deduction = min(deduction, dimension.max_deduction)

total_deductions = sum(d.actual_deduction for d in dimensions)
score = max(0, 100 - total_deductions)
```

## Classification Bands

| Score Range | Classification | Meaning |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| 90–100 | OPTIMIZED | Cluster is well-optimized; minimal waste detected |
| 75–89 | GOOD | Minor optimization opportunities exist |
| 60–74 | FAIR | Moderate waste; several actionable improvements available |
| 40–59 | NEEDS_WORK | Significant cost inefficiencies across multiple dimensions |
| 0–39 | CRITICAL | Severe waste; immediate action recommended |

### Classification Logic

```
if score >= 90: classification = "OPTIMIZED"
elif score >= 75: classification = "GOOD"
elif score >= 60: classification = "FAIR"
elif score >= 40: classification = "NEEDS_WORK"
else:            classification = "CRITICAL"
```

### Status Icons for Report

| Classification | Icon | Color |
|---------------|------|-------|
| OPTIMIZED | ✅ | Green |
| GOOD | ✅ | Blue |
| FAIR | ⚠️ | Yellow |
| NEEDS_WORK | ⚠️ | Orange |
| CRITICAL | ❌ | Red |

### Dimension Status Icons

| Actual Deduction | Icon | Meaning |
|-----------------|------|---------|
| 0 | ✅ | No issues found |
| 1 – 50% of max | ⚠️ | Minor issues |
| > 50% of max | ❌ | Significant issues |
| SKIPPED | ⏭️ | Not assessed |

## Report Filename Pattern

```
EKS-Cost-Intelligence-{cluster}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HHMM}.md
```

- `{cluster}` — the EKS cluster name as returned by `aws eks describe-cluster`
- `{YYYY-MM-DD}` — assessment date in ISO format
- `{HHMM}` — assessment time in 24-hour format (hours and minutes, no separator)

**Examples:**
- `EKS-Cost-Intelligence-prod-api-2024-11-15-0930.md`
- `EKS-Cost-Intelligence-staging-cluster-2024-12-01-1445.md`

## Recommendation Sort Order

Recommendations in the report are sorted by:

1. **Severity** (descending): CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
2. **Monthly savings** (descending within each severity level): highest savings first

## Methodology & Confidence Notes

### Data Sources Used

| Source | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Cost Explorer | {Available/Unavailable} | {Dollar-accurate spend data / Node-based estimation used} |
| Container Insights | {Available/Unavailable} | {Utilization-based analysis / Request-only analysis} |
| Kubernetes API | {Available/Unavailable} | {Resource inventory and configuration} |
| EC2 API | {Available/Unavailable} | {Instance types and pricing} |

### Estimation Methods

- **Cost attribution:** {method used — Cost Explorer tags, Split Cost Allocation, or node-based estimation}
- **Utilization data:** {source — Container Insights metrics, metrics-server, or request-only}
- **Savings estimates:** Conservative projections with {X}% confidence buffer applied

### Confidence Level

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| High | Cost Explorer + Container Insights available; dollar-accurate findings |
| Medium | Partial data; some estimates based on node-level pricing |
| Low | Node-based estimation only; findings are directional |

## Worked Example

### Scenario: Production cluster with moderate waste

**Findings collected:**
- Compute: 1 HIGH (over-provisioned pods, $847/mo waste)
- Spot/Graviton: 1 HIGH (no Spot usage, $380/mo), 1 MEDIUM (low Graviton, $200/mo)
- Networking: 1 MEDIUM (missing VPC endpoints, $150/mo)
- Storage: 1 MEDIUM (gp2 volumes, $36/mo)
- Observability: SKIPPED (Container Insights not enabled)
- Idle: 1 HIGH (orphaned LB, $432/mo)

**Score calculation:**

```
Compute:
  deduction = 25 × 0.3 = 7.5 (one HIGH finding)
  actual_deduction = min(7.5, 25) = 7.5

Spot/Graviton:
  deduction = 20 × 0.3 + 20 × 0.15 = 6.0 + 3.0 = 9.0 (one HIGH + one MEDIUM)
  actual_deduction = min(9.0, 20) = 9.0

Networking:
  deduction = 15 × 0.15 = 2.25 (one MEDIUM finding)
  actual_deduction = min(2.25, 15) = 2.25

Storage:
  deduction = 15 × 0.15 = 2.25 (one MEDIUM finding)
  actual_deduction = min(2.25, 15) = 2.25

Observability:
  status = SKIPPED → actual_deduction = 0

Idle:
  deduction = 15 × 0.3 = 4.5 (one HIGH finding)
  actual_deduction = min(4.5, 15) = 4.5

Total deductions = 7.5 + 9.0 + 2.25 + 2.25 + 0 + 4.5 = 25.5
Score = max(0, 100 - 25.5) = 74.5 → rounds to 74
Classification: FAIR (60–74)
```

### Scenario: Deduction cap in action

If Compute has 1 CRITICAL + 1 HIGH + 2 MEDIUM findings:

```
deduction = 25 × 0.6 + 25 × 0.3 + 25 × 0.15 + 25 × 0.15
          = 15.0 + 7.5 + 3.75 + 3.75
          = 30.0

actual_deduction = min(30.0, 25) = 25  ← capped at max_deduction
```

The dimension cannot lose more than its weight regardless of how many findings exist.
