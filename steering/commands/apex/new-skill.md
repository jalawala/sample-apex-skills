description: Onboard a new skill end-to-end — draft it, survey siblings, fan out the repo edits, and scaffold the eval set. Bimodal — greenfield authoring or retrofit on an existing skill.

<objective>
Run the APEX new-skill onboarding workflow — walk the contributor through scope intake, optional skill-creator drafting, sibling-graph survey, repo fan-out, and eval scaffold.

Follow the new-skill workflow end-to-end. Detect mode from `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — if it exists this is retrofit (skip Phase 2), otherwise greenfield. Use the steering-workflow-creator skill as the spec for conventions and the skill-creator skill for Phase 2 drafting in greenfield mode. Phases: 1) scope intake and mode detection, 2) draft via skill-creator (greenfield only), 3) survey sibling graph, 4) fan out repo edits, 5) scaffold evals, apply fan-out, open PR.
