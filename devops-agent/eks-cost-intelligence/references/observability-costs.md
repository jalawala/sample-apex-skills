# Observability Costs

> **Part of:** [eks-cost-intelligence](../SKILL.md)
> **Purpose:** Checks for EKS control plane logging configuration (all log types enabled unnecessarily), high-cardinality metric sources (Prometheus scrape configs, CloudWatch agent), DEBUG/TRACE log levels in production, and log filtering/sampling configurations (FluentBit, CloudWatch agent)

---

## Overview

Observability costs is a lower-weight dimension (10 points max deduction). It evaluates whether the cluster's logging, metrics, and tracing configurations are cost-efficient or generating unnecessary expense through excessive log ingestion, high-cardinality metrics, or verbose log levels in production.

CloudWatch Logs ingestion is one of the most common hidden costs in EKS clusters. A single cluster with all five control plane log types enabled can ingest 10–50 GB/month of logs at $0.50/GB (based on field experience; actual volume depends on cluster size and API activity) — often without anyone actively using them. Similarly, verbose application logging at DEBUG/TRACE levels or unfiltered Prometheus scrapes can generate hundreds of dollars in monthly charges.

### Checks Summary

| # | Check | Default Threshold | Severity Logic |
|---|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | EKS control plane logging (all log types) | All 5 types enabled in non-prod | By estimated CW Logs cost |
| 2 | High-cardinality metric sources | Prometheus scrape configs, CW agent | By metric count × cost |
| 3 | DEBUG/TRACE log levels in production | Any DEBUG/TRACE in prod namespaces | MEDIUM per workload |
| 4 | Log filtering/sampling configurations | Missing FluentBit filters or CW agent sampling | MEDIUM–HIGH |

---

## Pre-requisites

These checks require:
- **kubectl access** to the cluster (for ConfigMaps, DaemonSets, Deployments)
- **AWS CLI access** for `eks:DescribeCluster` (control plane logging config), `logs:DescribeLogGroups` (log group sizing)
- **Optional:** CloudWatch metrics for log ingestion volume (improves cost estimates)

No metrics-server is required — checks use configuration inspection and AWS API queries.

---

## Check 1: EKS Control Plane Logging Configuration

### What it detects

EKS clusters with all five control plane log types enabled when not all are necessary. Each enabled log type generates CloudWatch Logs ingestion at $0.50/GB. Many clusters enable all log types "just in case" — especially in non-production environments where audit and authenticator logs provide little operational value.

### Background

EKS control plane log types:
| Log Type | Typical Volume | Use Case |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| `api` | HIGH (5–20 GB/month) | API server request logging — audit trail |
| `audit` | HIGH (10–50 GB/month) | Detailed audit of all API operations |
| `authenticator` | LOW (0.5–2 GB/month) | Authentication decisions |
| `controllerManager` | MEDIUM (1–5 GB/month) | Controller reconciliation activity |
| `scheduler` | LOW (0.5–2 GB/month) | Pod scheduling decisions |

**Cost reference:** CloudWatch Logs ingestion = $0.50/GB. A cluster with all 5 types enabled can cost $10–$40/month in log ingestion alone. At scale (many clusters), this compounds to hundreds of dollars.

### Data collection

Use the EKS DescribeCluster API to check `logging.clusterLogging` configuration and identify which log types are enabled. Use the CloudWatch DescribeLogGroups API to get stored bytes for the `/aws/eks/<cluster>/cluster` log group. Use CloudWatch GetMetricData API for the IncomingBytes metric on the EKS log group to estimate 7-day ingestion volume and extrapolate to monthly cost.

### Analysis logic

```
enabled_log_types = list of enabled control plane log types

If len(enabled_log_types) == 5:  # All types enabled
  # Check if this is a production or non-production cluster
  # Indicators: cluster name contains "prod", tags contain "environment=production"
  
  cluster_tags = get cluster tags
  is_production = ("prod" in cluster_name) OR (tags["environment"] in ["production", "prod"])
  
  If NOT is_production:
    → Finding: all 5 log types enabled in non-production cluster
    recommendation = "Disable audit and authenticator logs in non-prod; keep api + controllerManager"
    severity = by estimated monthly cost
  
  If is_production:
    # In production, all types may be justified — check if audit logs are high volume
    If monthly_audit_ingestion_gb > 20:
      → Finding: high-volume audit logging — consider retention reduction or filtering
      recommendation = "Reduce audit log retention to 7 days or apply CloudWatch subscription filter"
      severity = by estimated monthly cost
    Else:
      → No finding (production with all types is a valid security posture)

If len(enabled_log_types) >= 3 AND len(enabled_log_types) < 5:
  # Partial enablement — check if audit is enabled without being used
  # No finding unless cost is significant (> $50/month)
  If monthly_ingestion_cost > 50:
    → Finding: consider whether all enabled types are actively monitored
    severity = MEDIUM

If len(enabled_log_types) == 0:
  # No logging at all — this is a security concern, not a cost concern
  # Note: NOT a cost finding. This is an operational risk captured by eks-operation-review.
  → No finding for cost dimension (skip)

# Check retention settings
log_retention = describe log group retention
If log_retention == "Never expire" AND monthly_ingestion_gb > 5:
  → Finding: unlimited retention on high-volume log group
  recommendation = "Set retention to 30-90 days for control plane logs"
  severity = by projected storage growth cost
```

### Cost estimation

```
CloudWatch Logs pricing (us-east-1 reference):
  Ingestion:  $0.50/GB
  Storage:    $0.03/GB/month
  Analysis:   $0.0065/GB scanned (Logs Insights queries)

Monthly control plane log cost estimate:
  ingestion_cost = monthly_ingestion_gb × $0.50
  storage_cost   = stored_gb × $0.03
  total_monthly  = ingestion_cost + storage_cost

Savings from disabling unnecessary log types:
  If all 5 types enabled and 2 disabled (audit + authenticator in non-prod):
    typical_savings = 60-70% of total ingestion (audit is highest volume)
```

### Severity classification

| Estimated Monthly Waste | Severity |
|-------------------------|----------|
| > $500 (rare for single cluster, possible with audit) | CRITICAL |
| $200–$500 | HIGH |
| $50–$200 | MEDIUM |
| < $50 | LOW |

### Remediation

```bash
# Disable unnecessary control plane log types (e.g., keep only api + controllerManager)
aws eks update-cluster-config \
  --name <cluster> \
  --logging '{
    "clusterLogging": [
      {
        "types": ["api", "controllerManager"],
        "enabled": true
      },
      {
        "types": ["audit", "authenticator", "scheduler"],
        "enabled": false
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```bash
# Set retention on control plane log group (default is Never Expire)
aws logs put-retention-policy \
  --log-group-name "/aws/eks/<cluster>/cluster" \
  --retention-in-days 30
```

```hcl
# Terraform — configure selective logging
resource "aws_eks_cluster" "main" {
  name = var.cluster_name
  # ...

  enabled_cluster_log_types = ["api", "controllerManager"]
  # Omit: "audit", "authenticator", "scheduler" in non-prod
}

# Set retention via aws_cloudwatch_log_group
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "eks_control_plane" {
  name              = "/aws/eks/${var.cluster_name}/cluster"
  retention_in_days = 30
}
```

## Check 2: High-Cardinality Metric Sources

### What it detects

Prometheus scrape configurations or CloudWatch agent settings that generate excessive metric cardinality, leading to high storage and query costs. High-cardinality metrics are the #1 cost driver for managed Prometheus (AMP) and CloudWatch custom metrics.

### Background

Common high-cardinality sources in EKS:
| Source | Cardinality Risk | Monthly Cost Impact |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Prometheus with all default scrapers | HIGH — can generate 500K+ active series | $200–$1000+ (AMP) |
| Unfiltered kube-state-metrics | MEDIUM — labels on every resource | $50–$200 |
| CW agent collecting all container metrics | MEDIUM — per-container per-metric | $50–$300 |
| Custom application metrics without aggregation | HIGH — per-user/per-request dimensions | Variable |
| ADOT collector with unfiltered spans | HIGH — per-trace storage | $100–$500+ |

**Cost reference:**
- Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP): $0.003/million samples ingested + $0.03/GB storage
- CloudWatch custom metrics: $0.30/metric/month (first 10K), $0.10/metric (next 240K)
- CloudWatch Logs (metric filter sources): $0.50/GB ingested

### Data collection

Use the Kubernetes API to list ConfigMaps containing Prometheus scrape configs (names matching prometheus/prom-/monitoring patterns). List ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor CRDs (monitoring.coreos.com/v1) across all namespaces. For each, check spec.endpoints[].metricRelabelings and scrape intervals.

Use the Kubernetes API to list ConfigMaps in the amazon-cloudwatch namespace for CloudWatch agent configuration. Check for OpenTelemetryCollector CRDs to detect ADOT collectors and their configuration.

Use the CloudWatch ListMetrics API to count custom metrics in the ContainerInsights and ContainerInsights/Prometheus namespaces for the cluster, assessing metric cardinality volume.

### Analysis logic

```
# Prometheus cardinality check
If Prometheus/AMP detected:
  scrape_configs = parse scrape configuration
  
  For each scrape job:
    has_metric_relabeling = (metricRelabelings is present and non-empty)
    scrape_interval = interval (default 30s)
    
    # Flag overly frequent scraping without filtering
    If scrape_interval < "15s" AND NOT has_metric_relabeling:
      → Finding: high-frequency scraping without metric filtering
      severity = MEDIUM
    
    # Flag scrape-all patterns (no metric_relabel_configs to drop unused metrics)
    If NOT has_metric_relabeling AND job_name matches "kubernetes-pods" or "kubernetes-service-endpoints":
      → Finding: unfiltered scrape target collecting all exposed metrics
      severity = MEDIUM

  # Check total ServiceMonitor + PodMonitor count
  total_monitors = count(ServiceMonitors) + count(PodMonitors)
  If total_monitors > 20 AND few have metricRelabelings:
    → Finding: many unfiltered metric monitors — likely high cardinality
    severity = HIGH (high cost potential)

# CloudWatch agent check
If CloudWatch agent detected:
  config = parse agent configuration
  
  If config.metrics.metrics_collected includes "kubernetes" with all container metrics:
    If no metric filtering/exclusion configured:
      → Finding: CloudWatch agent collecting all container metrics without filtering
      severity = MEDIUM
  
  If enhanced container insights is enabled with per-container metrics:
    → Finding: per-container metrics enabled — verify cost justification
    severity = LOW (may be intentional)

# ADOT collector check
If ADOT collector detected:
  If traces are collected without tail sampling:
    → Finding: ADOT collecting all traces without sampling
    severity = MEDIUM–HIGH (depends on trace volume)
```

### Severity classification

| Condition | Severity |
|-----------|----------|
| Active series > 500K (AMP) with estimated cost > $500/month | CRITICAL |
| Unfiltered Prometheus scraping all pod metrics + no relabeling | HIGH |
| CW agent collecting all container metrics without exclusions | MEDIUM |
| ServiceMonitors without metricRelabelings (> 10 monitors) | MEDIUM |
| ADOT collecting all traces without sampling | MEDIUM |
| Enhanced Container Insights enabled (per-container) | LOW |

## Check 3: DEBUG/TRACE Log Levels in Production

### What it detects

Workloads in production namespaces running with DEBUG or TRACE log levels, generating excessive log volume at $0.50/GB ingestion cost. Verbose logging in production is often left behind after troubleshooting sessions and can silently increase costs.

### Background

Log volume impact by level:
| Log Level | Typical Volume vs INFO | Monthly Cost Impact (per workload) |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| TRACE | 10–50× INFO volume | $10–$100+ per workload |
| DEBUG | 5–20× INFO volume | $5–$50+ per workload |
| INFO | Baseline | Baseline |
| WARN/ERROR | 0.01–0.1× INFO | Minimal |

### Data collection

Use the Kubernetes API to list all Deployments and StatefulSets in non-system namespaces. Inspect spec.template.spec.containers[].env for log level variables (LOG_LEVEL, LOGGING_LEVEL, LOG_LVL, RUST_LOG, LOGLEVEL) with values matching debug/trace/verbose. Check spec.template.spec.containers[].args for verbose flags (-v=5+, --debug, --verbose, --trace, --log-level=debug). Also inspect ConfigMaps referenced by workloads for log level settings.

### Analysis logic

```
production_namespaces = namespaces matching:
  - name contains "prod", "production", "prd"
  - labels contain "environment=production" OR "env=prod"
  - OR: all namespaces if cluster name indicates production

For each workload in production_namespaces:
  For each container:
    log_level = detect from:
      1. Environment variables: LOG_LEVEL, LOGGING_LEVEL, LOG_LVL, RUST_LOG, LOGLEVEL
      2. ConfigMap references with log level settings
      3. Command args: --debug, --verbose, -v=5+, --log-level=debug
    
    If log_level in ["debug", "trace", "verbose", "all"]:
      → Finding: verbose logging in production
      severity = MEDIUM (per workload)
      
      # Estimate cost impact
      replica_count = spec.replicas
      # Conservative: DEBUG adds ~5 GB/month per replica
      estimated_extra_gb = replica_count × 5
      estimated_monthly_cost = estimated_extra_gb × $0.50
```

### Severity classification

| Condition | Severity |
|-----------|----------|
| DEBUG/TRACE in production namespace, > 3 replicas | HIGH |
| DEBUG/TRACE in production namespace, ≤ 3 replicas | MEDIUM |
| DEBUG/TRACE in non-production namespace | LOW (informational only) |
| Multiple workloads with DEBUG in same prod namespace | HIGH (cumulative) |

### Remediation

```bash
# Patch deployment to set INFO log level
kubectl set env deployment/<deployment> -n <namespace> LOG_LEVEL=info

# Or patch specific environment variable
kubectl patch deployment <deployment> -n <namespace> --type=json -p='[
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value", "value": "info"}
]'
```

```yaml
# Use a ConfigMap for centralized log level management
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: logging-config
  namespace: <namespace>
data:
  LOG_LEVEL: "info"
  # Change to "debug" only during active troubleshooting
---
# Reference in Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: <deployment>

      - name: app
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: logging-config
```

> **Best practice:** Use a centralized log level ConfigMap that can be toggled during incidents without redeploying. Combine with a process to revert to INFO after troubleshooting windows.

---

## Check 4: Log Filtering and Sampling Configurations

### What it detects

Missing log filtering or sampling in the logging pipeline. Without filters, every log line (including noisy health checks, repetitive status messages, and low-value informational logs) is shipped to CloudWatch Logs or other destinations at full ingestion cost.

### Background

Common EKS logging pipelines:
| Component | Role | Filtering Capability |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| FluentBit (DaemonSet) | Log collection + forwarding | Filters, parsers, multiline, sampling |
| CloudWatch agent | Log + metric collection | Inclusion/exclusion patterns |
| Fluentd | Log collection + forwarding | Filters, transforms, buffering |
| ADOT (Fluent Forward) | Log collection via OTel | Processors, filters |

**Cost impact of unfiltered logging** (estimates based on field experience across production EKS deployments):
- Health check logs: 30–60% of total log volume in microservice architectures
- Kubernetes event noise: 5–15% of volume
- Repetitive status/heartbeat messages: 10–20% of volume

Filtering out this noise can reduce log ingestion costs by 40–70% (based on field experience; actual results vary by workload mix).

### Data collection

Use the Kubernetes API to read ConfigMaps for FluentBit (names matching fluent-bit/fluentbit patterns) and check DaemonSets for FluentBit deployment status. Parse the configuration data for [FILTER] sections, grep/exclude/throttle/sampling directives.

Use the Kubernetes API to read the CloudWatch agent ConfigMap in the amazon-cloudwatch namespace. Check for log_filters, exclude patterns, and namespace exclusion rules in the configuration.

Check for Fluentd ConfigMaps and DaemonSets via the Kubernetes API. Detect the overall logging pipeline by listing DaemonSets with known labels (fluent-bit, fluentd, cloudwatch-agent, adot-collector) to determine which log collection system is active.

### Analysis logic

```
# Step 1: Identify logging pipeline
pipeline = detect_logging_pipeline()  # FluentBit, Fluentd, CW Agent, ADOT, or None

If pipeline == None:
  # No centralized logging — either logs go directly to stdout/CloudWatch
  # or there's no pipeline (unusual in production)
  → Note: no logging pipeline detected — logs may use direct CloudWatch collection
  # Check if Container Insights is collecting logs directly
  If container_insights_logs_enabled:
    → Finding: Container Insights collecting all stdout/stderr without filtering
    severity = MEDIUM
  Else:
    → Skip (no logging cost to optimize)

# Step 2: Check for filtering in the detected pipeline
If pipeline == "FluentBit":
  config = parse FluentBit configuration
  
  has_exclude_filter = config contains [FILTER] with "Exclude" directive
  has_grep_filter = config contains [FILTER] with "Grep" or "grep" type
  has_throttle = config contains [FILTER] with "throttle" type
  has_sampling = config contains sampling rate configuration
  
  If NOT (has_exclude_filter OR has_grep_filter OR has_throttle OR has_sampling):
    → Finding: FluentBit running without any log filtering
    severity = HIGH (all logs shipped unfiltered — likely 40-70% unnecessary)
    monthly_waste_estimate = total_monthly_log_ingestion_cost × 0.40
  
  # Check for common missing filters
  If NOT config.excludes_health_checks:
    → Finding: health check logs not filtered
    severity = MEDIUM (health checks are typically 30-60% of log volume)
  
  If NOT config.excludes_kube_system:
    → Finding: kube-system namespace logs not filtered
    severity = LOW

If pipeline == "CloudWatch Agent":
  config = parse CW agent configuration
  
  If config.logs.logs_collected.kubernetes.log_filters is null or empty:
    → Finding: CloudWatch agent collecting all logs without filtering
    severity = MEDIUM
  
  If config lacks exclude patterns for health checks:
    → Finding: health check logs not excluded from collection
    severity = MEDIUM

# Step 3: Estimate cost savings from filtering
If has_filtering_finding:
  # Get current log ingestion cost
  monthly_ingestion_gb = get CloudWatch Logs IncomingBytes metric
  monthly_ingestion_cost = monthly_ingestion_gb × $0.50
  
  # Conservative estimate: filtering saves 40% of ingestion
  estimated_savings = monthly_ingestion_cost × 0.40
```

### Severity classification

| Condition | Severity |
|-----------|----------|
| No log filtering at all (pipeline running, no filters) | HIGH |
| Health check logs not filtered (30-60% of volume) | MEDIUM |
| No sampling on high-throughput services (> 1000 logs/sec) | MEDIUM |
| Filtering present but missing common exclusions | LOW |
| No logging pipeline detected (logs go nowhere or direct CW) | LOW (informational) |

## Scoring Contribution

The observability costs dimension has a **maximum deduction of 10 points**.

### Deduction calculation

```
deduction = 0

For each finding in this dimension:
  If severity == CRITICAL: deduction += 10 × 0.6 = 6.0
  If severity == HIGH:     deduction += 10 × 0.3 = 3.0
  If severity == MEDIUM:   deduction += 10 × 0.15 = 1.5
  If severity == LOW:      deduction += 10 × 0.05 = 0.5

actual_deduction = min(deduction, 10)  # Cap at maximum
```

### Dimension status

| Condition | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| All checks completed | ASSESSED |
| Some checks skipped (no logging pipeline) | ASSESSED (with note) |
| Cannot access cluster logging config at all | SKIPPED |

If the dimension is fully SKIPPED, it contributes **zero deduction** and is excluded from the score denominator.

| Ingestion | $0.50/GB |
| Storage (standard) | $0.03/GB/month |
| Storage (infrequent access) | $0.0125/GB/month |
| Logs Insights queries | $0.0065/GB scanned |
| Live Tail | $0.01/minute per session |

### Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP)

|-----------|------|
| Sample ingestion | $0.003/million samples |
| Storage (first 2 months) | $0.03/GB/month |
| Query processing | $0.007/million samples scanned |

### CloudWatch custom metrics

| Volume | Cost per metric/month |
|--------|----------------------|
| First 10,000 | $0.30 |
| Next 240,000 | $0.10 |
| Next 750,000 | $0.05 |
| Over 1,000,000 | $0.02 |

### Quick cost estimation formulas

```
# Control plane log cost
control_plane_monthly_cost = monthly_ingestion_gb × $0.50 + stored_gb × $0.03

# Application log cost savings from filtering
filtering_savings = total_monthly_log_gb × filter_reduction_percentage × $0.50
# Conservative filter_reduction_percentage: 0.40 (40%)
# Aggressive (with health check + debug removal): 0.60 (60%)

# Prometheus/AMP cost from cardinality
amp_monthly_cost = active_series × samples_per_series_per_month × $0.003/million
# samples_per_series_per_month at 30s interval = 86,400 samples/day × 30 = 2,592,000/month
# 100K active series at 30s scrape = 259.2 billion samples/month = ~$777/month

# CloudWatch agent metric cost
cw_metric_cost = unique_metric_count × $0.30 (first 10K) or $0.10 (10K-250K)
```
